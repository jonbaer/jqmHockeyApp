Demo of Jquery Mobile and HockeyApp.net using PhoneGap

Please note:
The HockeyKit contained is non-standard.

The aim is to be able to have a javascript event that can indicate updates available, and functions to indicate this via alert or color a div
Or just collect the update.

HockeyKit has an excelent install screen, which is not being used here to allow total control of user interaction with HTML/JS and the alerts from HockeyKit that are available.
