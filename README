Demo of Jquery Mobile and HockeyApp.net using PhoneGap

Please note:
The HockeyKit contained is non-standard.

The aim is to be able to have a an init that passes a "when do I want to check again" and a cb routine that indicates Updates ready.
Any alerts should from HockeyKit should be optionally suppressed.
HockeyKit alerts should be available to javascript (like showCheckForUpdateAlert).
Needs a new option in HockeyKit, something like suppressAlerts (I know where to put them: TODO)
